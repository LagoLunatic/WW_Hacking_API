; This patch contains fixes to various bugs present in vanilla Wind Waker.


; If the player heals grandma but doesn't have an empty bottle for her to put soup in because they swapped their equipped item out too fast, grandma will crash the game because she tries to say a message that doesn't exist in the game's script.
; Change grandma to say the same message regardless of whether you have an empty bottle or not.

  ; This line originally hardcoded message ID 2041, which would be the message grandma says when you heal her without an empty bottle.
  ; Change it to 2037, which is the normal message ID when you do have an empty bottle.
